Python shooting game using pygame and made for HA laser tracker
This was my first personal python project.  I used a projector to display the screen on the wall.  I had a training pistol that would "shoot" a red dot laser when fired.  The webcam would recognize the dot on the wall and coordinate the correct location of the hit.
